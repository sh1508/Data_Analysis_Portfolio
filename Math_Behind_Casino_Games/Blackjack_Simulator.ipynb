    "In this notebook, I explored [Jackson Gayda's Blackjack Simulator on Github](https://github.com/jgayda/blackjack-simulator) (shoutout to him for building such a cool tool from scratch!) and made a few modifications to his code to simulate blackjack games over a specified number of hands (e.g., 100 or 1000), and repeated the simulation multiple times (e.g., 10,000 times with 400 hands per run). The results are then plotted to analyze the distributions of final bankrolls."
